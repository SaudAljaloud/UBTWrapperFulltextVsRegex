Building:
cd root/path/
mvn clean install
mvn dependency:copy-dependencies 
This will download all dependances in to path target/dependency which will be used when runing the scripts
The file: "config.kb.tdblucene" contains the configrations for each triple store, the data path should point to the dir where is should ideally be at ../../LUBM/LUBM...
and all rdf should be in RDF/XML formate and should have the prefix "University" to be processed.
 

Then, either edit/run the file bulkTest.sh for all triple stores, or

cd to the cosen store and:

Run sh ./load_ubt_*.sh // for loading data into a seprate directory within the project.
Run sh ./query_ubt_*.sh // for querying the tripe store from the file "config.query.lubm-fulltext.sparql.larq"
Find the result in a text file start with Result and suffixed with date and time.
