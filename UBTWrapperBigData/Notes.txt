BigData Indexing Notes:

It seems that BigDat is using toknisation for the text index. When searching for a query like:
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX ub: <http://www.lehigh.edu/~zhp2/2004/0401/univ-bench.owl#>
prefix bd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf/search#>
SELECT ?X
WHERE {
  ?lit bd:search "network engineer" .
  ?lit bd:matchExact "true" .
  ?X ub:publicationText ?lit .
}

This will return 6 results, unliek others wich return only 3. When checking the text, it seems that text like "network engineering" are return, which indicates that the tokinsation is presented.
